    question:
      "How do AI tools accelerate development without compromising quality?",
    answer:
      "Our developers use AI tools as intelligent assistants, not replacements. We combine AI-generated code suggestions with human oversight, code reviews, and testing to ensure quality while dramatically increasing development speed. The AI handles repetitive tasks, allowing our experts to focus on architecture, business logic, and creative solutions.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What types of projects are best suited for AI-powered development?",
    answer:
      "AI-powered development works exceptionally well for web applications, mobile apps, APIs, and SaaS platforms. It's particularly effective for projects with standard patterns, CRUD operations, and UI-heavy applications. We also excel at modernizing legacy systems and building MVPs quickly for startups.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you ensure code security and maintainability?",
    answer:
      "We implement rigorous code review processes, automated testing, and security scanning. All AI-generated code is thoroughly reviewed by senior developers, follows established coding standards, and includes comprehensive documentation. We also provide ongoing maintenance and support to ensure long-term code health.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What's the typical timeline for an AI-powered development project?",
    answer:
      "Projects typically complete 60-80% faster than traditional development. A standard web application that might take 3-4 months traditionally can often be completed in 4-6 weeks. Complex enterprise applications see similar acceleration. We provide detailed timeline estimates during our initial consultation.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Do you provide training for teams wanting to adopt AI development tools?",
    answer:
      "Yes! We offer comprehensive training programs to help your internal teams adopt AI development tools effectively. This includes workshops on tool selection, best practices, workflow integration, and ongoing mentorship to ensure successful adoption and maximum productivity gains.",
  },
  {
    question: "What AI tools do you use in your development process?",
    answer:
      "We use a comprehensive suite of AI tools including Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Replit Agent, Vercel v0, Figma AI, and many others. Our team stays current with the latest tools and continuously evaluates new ones to ensure we're using the most effective solutions for each project.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "How do you handle projects that require custom or complex logic?",
    answer:
      "Our team has deep expertise in traditional development approaches alongside AI tools. When projects require highly custom logic, complex algorithms, or specialized implementations, we seamlessly blend AI assistance with traditional development practices to deliver optimal results.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's included in your post-launch support?",
    answer:
      "We provide comprehensive post-launch support including bug fixes, performance monitoring, security updates, and feature enhancements. Our support packages are tailored to your needs and can include ongoing development, technical consultation, and emergency response services.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you price AI-powered development projects?",
    answer:
      "Our pricing reflects the accelerated development timeline while maintaining competitive rates. Since we can deliver projects 60-80% faster, you often save significantly on total project costs despite our premium expertise. We offer both fixed-price and time-and-materials options depending on project scope.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you work with our existing development team?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely! We often collaborate with client development teams, providing AI expertise, training, and augmented development capacity. We can integrate seamlessly into your existing workflows and help your team adopt AI development practices effectively.",
